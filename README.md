# Hello-World
After working in the Pharmaceutical Quality Assurance field for over 3 years, I career shifted to being a Military Spouse and Mom of 4.  After frequent moves and raising children, I have begun a career shift to IT, while maintaining my Quality viewpoint.  I am taking a variety of online classes.
