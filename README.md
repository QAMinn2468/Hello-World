# Hello-World
My repository to greet the world
After working in the Pharmaceutical Quality Assurance field for over 3 years, I career shifted to being a Military Spouse and Mom of 4.  After frequent moves and raising children, I am ready to career shift once more into IT, while maintaining my Quality viewpoint.
My goal is to see how quickly I can ramp up into IT.
